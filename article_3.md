# Article 3: Hobbies

- Got a bike to the flat I'm currently residing near my workplace which I like to bike to work sometimes and would also go around for leisure cruising in my bike and just enjoying the scenery and cityscape around me.
- I also like to do art yet I weren't able to invest a lot of time in it before. Now I have many free time, I like to bring my tablet and cycle to beautiful parks or sunset-viewing-spots near my place and just lose myself in the world of the digital canvas and soothing music from my headphone.
