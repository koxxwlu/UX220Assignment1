# Article 4: Occupation

- Since I graduated from a UXD major, I'm obviously getting a UX job right off university. I'm currently a principle designer after 3 years of being a junior learning in a start-up design firm, and working 2 years in this current company. Great colleagues, great culture, and great flexibility.
- I'm loving my current job, though I don't know how long will this last since there are rumours circulating the division that they are scaling back to save on budget.
