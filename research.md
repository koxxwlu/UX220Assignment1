# Research on Student Portfolio Goals

Students are provide with self-assessment tools to evaluate how well they completed the given tasks, and enable them to review their own progress over time by tabulating results of tasks across the semester. Teachers/students can also invite the another party to conduct a review on what they believe can be done better, and how.

On the other side, it also mentioned the method of student-to-teacher portfolio presentation to critically evaluate student’s performance throughout the semester. This presentation highlights students’ skill acquisition and to provide evidence of their learning process accompanied with outcome. Through this process, students are able to self-reflect and assess on how they set goals, hence encourage their affection towards learning.

I think the self-assessment approach is effective since it provides tools for students to visualise their performance thus allow them to understand their improvement or areas needing more effort. However, this method requires immense amount of self-discipline since they lack motivators to conduct such assessment on themselves.
In contrast, the student-teacher portfolio presentation incorporates the same advantages self-assessment has, but allows teachers to act as accountability partner for students, solving the issue of students lacking self-discipline to faithfully evaluate themselves in a timely manner.
